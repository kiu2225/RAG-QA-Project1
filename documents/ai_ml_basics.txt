Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future.

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain, allowing it to learn from large amounts of data. While a neural network with a single layer can make approximate predictions, additional hidden layers can help optimize the accuracy.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics, in its pursuit to fill the gap between human communication and computer understanding.

Computer Vision is a field of AI that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects and then react to what they see.

AI applications are widespread and include virtual assistants, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis. The field continues to evolve rapidly with advances in computing power, algorithms, and available data.
